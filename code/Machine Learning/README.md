# Fruit Classification using DenseNet121

## Project Description
This repository Brancg is dedicated to the development of a fruit classification model using the DenseNet121 architecture. The model is trained on the Fruits-360 dataset to classify fruit images into various categories.

## Repository Structure
- `data/` - Contains the training and validation datasets.
- `models/` - Stores the saved model files.
- `notebook/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- `oldCode/` - Archive of older versions of the project code.
- `src/` - Source code for training and prediction scripts.
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies for the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare your dataset in the `data/` directory with subdirectories for training and validation.
4. Run training: `python src/train.py`
5. Perform predictions: `python src/predict.py`

## Dataset
The model should be trained using the Fruits-360 dataset. Ensure the data is structured properly as per the instructions in the 'data/' directory.
